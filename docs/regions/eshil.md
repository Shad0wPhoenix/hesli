# Eshil

Eshil is known as the region of many faces; one moment the sweet aroma of flowers with accompanying flying critters create a cloud of acivity. Yet, within days travel, one can stumble upon a dense and eerie forest filled with the whispers of ancient myths and legends, or be surrounded by the high snowcapped peaks. It is an intricate balance that the region has masters over eons.

> There are few places I've visited where the landscape changes around every corner. It truly feels like teleporting to a completely different place. A true joy for any cartographer.. or a nightmare. - Edwige Pennsworth

However, beneath the beauty of natures hides a conflict that - fortunately - hasn't left any visible mark yet. The Kingdom of Illtresi wants a firmer grasp on the activities and services that the Limani Supplies Dealer provide, whereas the trading company wants to keep its freedom while supporting the Kingdom on the sidelines. In their struggle for power, they are blinded to the other dangers brewing in the shadows.

## Diverse Regions
There is tons Eshil has to offer to anyone looking for an adventure. Here people can scour the mountains for hidden treasure in caves, learn about all the different animals keeping the farming ecosystem alive, or simply Looking for some heads to pounce in exchange for coin.

> Hey you, I heard you were looking for some quests! I highly advice you to make your way to [the Wandering Lileon](./limani/wanderingLileon.md) in [Limani](./eshil/limani.md); they have the best brew and food in the region, but most important of all a good quest board to get you started! How do I know? Well, I might be the one supplying the quests. - Ashish Ludak

### Gardens of Bermuth
Rich meadows filled with a wide variety of flowers gives this biome its well deserved name. Patches of small forests dotted around gives the grazing wildlife its much needed shade and cover from predators. Some even claim to have sighted a ForestPhoenix somewhere among these trees.

#### Limani
At the mouth of the river flowing into the sea lies the port town of [Limani](./eshil/limani.md), known for originating the enormous enterprise that dominates the economy of the region. There's always work to be done and not enough hands to do them, making it the perfect starting point for anyone wanting to take their first steps into life as an adventurer, thief, or merchant.

### Greze Urngorr
The mountains of Greze Urngorr are easily recognised from far away; their rounded peaks resemble something akin to oversized hills. Many paths lead through this range to get people and caravans to the other side. Underneath the rocky exterior, cave systems provide a vital lifeline to the few critters and the various fungi and plantlife who call these mountains their home.

### The Towers
Contrary to the inviting rounded mountains of Greze Urngorr, the sharp spikes of The Towers of Day and Night deter people from traversing the trecherous paths turning them into the most natural border of Eshil. Many myths and legends surround these mountains which gave them their names. People believe these mountains are lifeless, but something in the depths of the range suggests otherwise.

### Mazurka Hills
Hills stretching far and wide consisting of farmland and pastures; it comes as no surprise that the Mazurka Hills is a thriving farming community. They produce nearly every crop imaginable and provide nearly the entire region of meat and healthy animals using their husbandaries. Still, the community tries to live in harmony with nature, allowing the natural predators to make their kills and using the buzzing polinators to make sure their crops continue to grow.

### Yellow Groves
Home to one of the largest druid circles known to Hesli among the large patches of forest, the Yellow Groves provide shelter to everyone who needs a break from everyday life. Brimming with plants and animals, there is always something new to explore. The most notable plant of these groves is the Yellow Yew, a large tree that grows as old as time named after the tiny yellow leaves that pop up during autumn.

### Theorston Thicket
An eerie, dark purple hue in the distance, that is without a doubt Theorston Thicket; former home to Archmage Anvar who left his mark ever so clear in his wake. The leafless trees and the morphed animals that dare make this their home puts shivers down many spines. It is inadvisable to enter this darkness.

### Lonely Marshes
Between the Towers of the Night and the Spikes of Narbu, a sea of Silkweed and Helleborne covers the large area in between. Weaving through the trees and plants are patches of moss sticking out over the water. It is difficult to see where the river ends and the puddles start, making it easy to get lost either over land or in the waters.

### Finntonmor
Similar to the Mazurka Hills, the people of Finntonmor are a thriving farming community, focusing less on crops but more on animals. With the sea at their side, one can find many small fishing villages along the coastline. Trekking through this region can be very lonely with the endless grasslands which could lead to some interesting experiences.

### Bani Reshumbra
On the other side of the river lies the less explored Bani Reshumbra, a savanna filled with large predator animals and little cover. Not much is known about this region, making it quite the exotic adventure for any curious mind. However, few have returned unscatched after venturing into this savanna.

### Spikes of Narbu
According to legends, the Spikes of Narbu are a creation meant to deter people from ever traversing to the other side. While some may have tried, it is unknown if it's possible to get past them as many of the paths leading through this mountain range usually lead to a dead end. Birds are the only creatures seen nesting and calling these mountains their home.

## Diverse People
Just like its landscape, Eshil supports a large variety of ethnicities with its bountiful lands. From elves to dwarfs, from gnomes to humans, everyone has a place and a part to play.

### The Dwarfs: Mandri & Briyani
These brothers in arms may be of the same species, but their demeanor is completely opposite. The Mandri love their rugged mountain homes and swinging (pick)axes around, whereas the Briyani are in tune with their modest nature and - surprisingly - proficient magic users.

> Dwarfs using magic?! I've never heard of such thing! I must see this with my own two eyes.

### The Elves: Quani & Drani
Together, these elves stand against the Eilmari and their core principles; elves ought to work together with each other and with other species, they are far from the superior being the Eilmari tend to believe. Taking care of the living organisms of the land is their calling, regardless of origin.

> I.. I thought high elves could only bathe in pure water? How come these Drani don't have any issue getting in the river? Is it just a myth from the Eilmari to further drive home their importance?

### The Humans: <name> & <name>
Stubborn as they always are, the humans of <name> & <name> are a force to be reckoned with; they will continue to try and find a new way to get what they want, much to dismay of the people around them. However, more and more people of Eshil are starting to see the appeal and rely on these fleshy beings to find solutions to seemingly impossible requests.
