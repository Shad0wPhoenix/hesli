    "content": "In reality, members of the Keepers Order are the Gatekeepers of the Realm of Eternal Slumber. The swamps of Hesli are very closely connected to this realm, which allows for people beyond the veil to turn back in the form of a ghost to the swamps during a full moon. The same goes the other way; adventurers travelling through the swamp during a full moon can teleport themselves into the @[The Realm of Eternal Slumber](location:9fdf7ed3-0e24-4cd5-9608-9f332d9fd893). Contrary to the people beyond the veil, the adventurers can return to the mortal world with their flesh intact.",
