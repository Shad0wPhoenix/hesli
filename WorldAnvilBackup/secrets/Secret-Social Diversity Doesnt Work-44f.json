Children are swapped solely with other children of the same social class, meaning that they stay in the same, or at least a very similar, environment with hardly any cultural and perspective changes. This further bolsters what they know and have been taught, making them more complient to what the counsil says.\nMeanwile the kids in a lower class, get reaffirmed that there is no escaping the class system and working your way to the top is nearly impossible.",
