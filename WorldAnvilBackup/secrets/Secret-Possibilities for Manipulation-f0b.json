    "content": "While Homestead seems like a solid system, there are flaws. Every entry that is made is recorded in a database which contains the question being asked and the person who asked the question as part of the dataset. This can be manipulated, leading to requests being made without a (seemingly?) traceable source. If gnomes do not catch this occurance, it could be misused to guide Homestead into providing laws that could work in the favour of a certain group of people. Homestead technicians are the only ones who have access to the database and thus the only ones to fix the problem... or cause it.",
