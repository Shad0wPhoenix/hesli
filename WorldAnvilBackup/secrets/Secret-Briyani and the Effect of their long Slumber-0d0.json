    "content": "The Briyani have been asleep in the ground for at least a thousand years. Their memory of the time before they were put in this slumber is very foggy and they cannot access it easily.\n\nThe Briyani [b]know[/b] the original tale of how the world was created. They [b]know[/b] who @[Luna](person:0e1f6b74-918d-4d85-874e-0bd0bce49aa1) is and that she went missing. They [b]know[/b] that the world has been lead by dragons in the past, but they always have been on good terms with them until @[The Draconic War](document:59bb8ea4-4e1f-4d47-9d3b-6761de8ac899) was unleashed. However, they are aware that only a select number of dragons caused this war and not all of them.\n\nThe memory of before their sleep can only be access via high level rituals and even then it has a slim chance to work in obtaining the information.",
