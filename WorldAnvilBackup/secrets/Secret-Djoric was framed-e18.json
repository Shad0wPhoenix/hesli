    "content": "The event that Djoric was accused of was a grave one. However, it is also one that he did not commit. He was framed by someone who wanted him out of the city and the country.\n\nHowever, Djoric doesn't like to talk about it, as there is nothing that he can do about the situation. Nor does he think that anyone else can do something about it either, so he'd rather let it slide.\n\nIf asked about it, he'll narrate what he has been told. If people press him further into revealing the truth, he'll get grumpy and possibly kick people out of his shop.",
