Writing more words on worldbuilding! \\o/ I'm super stoked to put time and energy into writing for my world. As for my goals, I intend to further develop my first region @[Eshil](location:251eb80c-8462-4cd2-ae93-dbb4ecb74af8). Right now, it has a map, and one big-ish town and two proper NPCs. That's not a whole lot.\r\n\r\nHowever, Eshil not being filled to the brim with all things worldbuilding, does leave me with the creative freedom to add a ton of things to it. Half of the species are largely done, which means I still have the other half to develop during World Ember. Furthermore, there are some religions that need expanding and creation, plus a lot of organisations, natural monuments, forests, landschapes... Yeah, you can see where this is going.\r\n\r\nSo, how do I intend to obtain 10.000+ words of worldbuilding during December? Simple, really.\r\n\r\n[quote][center][color:#00ff00][section: far fa-2x fa-duotone fa-fire fa-swap-opacity] [/section]\r\nLET THE CHAOS COMMENCE!\r\n[section: far fa-2x fa-duotone fa-fire fa-swap-opacity] [/section][/color][center]\r\n[sub]<Insert Evil Elmo Gif Here>[/sub]\r\n|ShadowPhoenix[/quote]\r\n\r\nWill I go about this as a headless chicken? Well, partially, yes. It works for me, so why not? I have my planning article next to me an a whole load of stubs that I can work on to expand my world further. But I do not want to limit myself to working on [i]just that[/i]. If inspiration comes up, I should use that moment to create awesome, new, and (let's be honest to ourselves) weird worldbuilding. And if I do get stuck, I always have @[my region meta](article:7565e0a2-5b8a-4a1d-8e93-066fcb85a1e1), @[my Nanowrimo & Worldember Prep Shenanigans article](article:e92af60a-ee3d-4d8c-992f-af62727a7a27), and Edwige's Epic Escapades that will get my inspiration flowing instantly. Or so I hope.\r\n\r\nI have made sure that my category tree is capable of taking a hit on all the articles I'll be writing. It should have the space to fit them all. However, I don't want to panic about where I should put my articles. Instead, I'll dunk them all in the same category and sort of my mess later. So much for procrastination, right? So, if you happen to come across some of my work, and you want to read what more shenanigans I've created during World Ember, just have a peek in the category. (Or, you could have a look at my world ember author page... didn't think of that yet.)\r\n\r\n[row][col][book:6e646bea-8b69-4989-91fe-55b84a9492f9][/col][col][manuscript:13890eb0-87c1-49ce-81ca-9d896cffac8e][/col][/row]\r\n\r\n[img:3903468]",

It expands every couple months with new articles, mostly expansion on the short descriptions I had given before. Think \"Write all species\" turning into \"Write Humans, Dwarfs, High Elfs, etc\". For WorldEmber this year, I intend to use the same article as a guide, especially for moments when I lose overview of what I've written and need a way back to what I have to write.\r\n\r\n[articleblock:7565e0a2-5b8a-4a1d-8e93-066fcb85a1e1]\r\n[articleblock:e92af60a-ee3d-4d8c-992f-af62727a7a27]",

However, the past year has taught me that pacing myself and accepting that I cannot do everything I want is important to keep my mental health in check. Therefore, I have set myself a few healthy goals for this World Ember to adhere to where I can.\r\n\r\n[i]Of course, I might slip up since this goblin has resided in me for so long. But every small step in the right direction is a step forward! Therefore, both for me and also for you reading this and wanting to get into a more healthy shape yourself, accept that slipping up is part of the process![/i]\r\n\r\n[ul][li]I will not force myself to write when I don't feel like it. I am allowed to see if I can break through a demotivated day by making myself write for 5 minutes. If, after that, I still don't want to write, I will lay down my pen for that moment and do something else.[/li]\r\n[li]I will enjoy myself while writing, no matter the wordcount.[/li]\r\n[li]I will take a break and go for a walk when I have written for more than two hours, because breaks are important.[/li]\r\n[li]I will go to the gym twice a week, to ensure that I become more physically healthy.[/li]\r\n[li]I will try to walk for 30-60mins every day to get fresh air.[/li][/ul]",

With the help of many members of the community, I've been able to get it to the point where it is right now. So, I won't be spending much time working on my css. Since I already have a sort of standard layout of how I present things, I'll leave that for during the article writing to play and toy with. I like to do most of those things in the moment to see how each layout fits whatever message I'm trying to convey. And also to allow my artistic dork of an eye to have some fun as well.\r\n\r\nMost of the images will either be placeholder images, or I'll look for them on sites as [url:https://unsplash.com/]Unspash[/url].
