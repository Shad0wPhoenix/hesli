    "content": "Whooo beasties! Who doesn't love them? And those we don't love, we'll just call them monsters and let our players slay them, right? ^^ I've put most, if not all, these beasties in their corresponding region in my article about @[Eshil](location:251eb80c-8462-4cd2-ae93-dbb4ecb74af8) (still a WIP at the time of writing!), so you can find them there as well. Now, let's see what creatures my brain will conjure. This article will be more of a brainstorm article where I just chuck down some ideas on the several prompts. If I end up turning one of those ideas into an actual article, I'll make sure to add them to the sidebar.\r\n\r\n[h1]Entries[/h1]\r\n[row][container:col-md-9][h2]Wings: The Grass Skipper[/h2]\r\nWhenever you're travelling through the meadows of the Gardens of Bermuth, you can see tiny birds shooting over the high grass tops. These Grass Skippers fly at immense speeds through the tops to gather insects and other... well, to them snacks. The males have bright yellow feathers, making them easily visible among the grass. The females, on the other hand, have feathers that camouflage them when sitting high up in the treetops brooding on a fresh nest of eggs. With their brown feathers, they are nearly invisible both in the trees and among the flooring of the meadows.\r\n\r\nGrass Skippers love the meadows as long as there are patches of medium to high grass. Other than in the Gardens of Bermuth, you can find them in Finntonmor as well. A close cousin of the Grass Skipper has adapted itself to the shorter grass of Bani Reshumba. Fighting these little fellas should not be underestimated. While taking on one of two won't pose much of a challenge, you'll certainly think differently when facing a swarm of these little birds.[/container][container:col-md-3][container:edwigeQuote edwigeBottom]You should see these little fellas go![br][b][i]Zoom zoom zoom!![/i][/b][/container][img:3570560][/container][/row]\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n[h2]Stripes: Sharayit[/h2]\r\nThe Sharayit got their name for how they look to the normal eye. Their specie is considered the fastest at climbing, whether that's trees or entire mountains. All people would see is a vertical stripe. \"The Mountains Descent\" was a popular myth among dwarves who described a spectacle on the mountains, where it was imbued with stripes of different colours. In reality, it was the mating season of the Sharayit and they gathered at the mountains to show off their climbing skills to potential partners.\r\nThere are multiple varieties of Sharayit, each having evolved to accomodate their climbing areas most. The most well known ones are the Sharayit Jibal (mountain sharayit) and the Sharayit Ghaba (forest sharayit). There are rumours of a water based sharayit, the Sharayit May, but researchers have yet to confirm their existence.\r\n[row][container:col-md-3][img:3570560][/container][container:col-md-9][container: edwigeQuote edwigeLeft]Man, these four legged things be quicc. I wish I could climb that fast, that woulda solved a lot of problems![/container][/container][/row]\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n[h2]Horn: Bilhoorn[/h2]\r\nThe bilhoorn is a staple animal in Eshil as it is used by the @[Limani Supplies Dealer](organization:5e89421c-6ff3-4051-bdeb-d087f1934349) to pull along the carriages full of tradewares. Its large frame and intense muscular build have granted them with immense power to tug along large loads. Their most notible feature are their horns. Starting at the head a single big horn points forward and splits into two smaller horns at the end.\r\n\r\nOriginally, the bilhoorn could be found grazing in the Gardens of Bermuth. However, since the company started using and breeding them amass, very few of these animals still roam in the wild. Still, if encountered alone, their fighting instincts will kick in as them charge towards any threat they face.\r\n[row][container:col-md-9][container:edwigeQuote edwigeRight]Whoah.. Damn, you're twice my height and I can even fit in your horn alone![/container][/container][container:col-md-3][img:3570560][/container][/row]\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n[row][container: col-md-3][container:edwigeQuote edwigeBottom]We... we made it out la-dee-da-dee. Holy hell, never again, those things scare the living poopies out of me.[/container][img:3570560][/container][container:col-md-9][h2]Shell: Bahtirs[/h2]\r\nLet me give you a fair warning, don't wander near Theorston Thicket if you don't want to encounter your worst nightmare. These nasty creatures inhabit the dead, using it as a shell to protect their true nature. There are a few small cues to tell a Bahtir apart from the shell it lives in. First and foremost, the eyes of who they inhibit turn full black. So, while it might be easy to spot a Bahtir inhabiting a human, or high elf, it's much more difficult to tell them apart from beady eyed animals. Second, a Bahtir that recently inhabited a corpse still has to get familiar with the movement patterns and interacting with the specie. Therefore, if one knows how a certain specie should move or respond, they can detect the Bahtir. That is, unless the Bahtir has inhabitted the corpse for a long enough time to have blended in with the specie.\r\n\r\nThe only way to get rid of Bahtirs, is to destroy the host body first while making sure there is no other medium for the Bahtir to use. When there is nowhere to go, it has no choice but to ooze out of its shell. In that moment, they are at their most vulnerable, but also their most powerful. So... be careful.[/container][/row]\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n[row][container:col-md-9][h2]Colourful: Rainbow Centipede[/h2]\r\nOne of the most colourful insects of Eshil brighten the fifty shades of gray in the mountains. The rainbow centipede and millipede come in a variety of colours and patterns. Every segment develops into a different colour from the previous segment. Each colour pattern is unique, coming from a random DNA strain combined with the DNA of the parents. The orange legs carry the centepede and millipedes to different heights.\r\n\r\nWhile they are most common in the mountains, sometimes a few wander in the forests and greenery at the foot of the ranges. However, they will never travel too far from the mountains, as they sustain themselves with the mineral rich water from the caves and the nutrient dense Ugwu Hoppers.[/container][container:col-md-3][img:3570560][container:edwigeQuote edwigeTop]So pretty! They're too pretty to be scary![/container][/container][/row]\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n[h2]Nocturnal: Midknight Cricket[/h2]\r\nComing out after dark in packs of four to six, the Midknight Crickets patrol their territories while their friends, the Fremble Crickets forage for food. The Midknight Crickets fiercy protect their families and their cousins the Fremble Crickets. For this, they have a very sturdy armour that can resist many normal weaponry. The two front legs are as sharp as swords and often used to make paths through the dense forests where they live. Standing tall at roughly the same height as an ordinary dog, crossing paths with a patrol of these crickets can be fatal for inexperienced adventurers.\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n[h2]Mystical: Unicorn[/h2]\r\nA staple in many tales of heroism and myths, the Unicorn is undoubtedly a mystical creature. Some claim that the unicorn is a reincarnation of the purest souls that have travelled to the @[The Realm of Eternal Slumber](location:9fdf7ed3-0e24-4cd5-9608-9f332d9fd893) that have been granted the gift of living again.\r\n\r\nWhile no one has ever seen a unicorn before, people have made avid descriptions and visual representations of what they believe the unicorn to look like. These unique descriptions from person to person, family to family, further dives into the mysticality that surrounds this inexplicible creature.\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n[h2]Prey: Phurrick[/h2]\r\nThe phurrick is a very tame hamster with long hair. They simply graze on grass or munch on leaves as they scurry through the forests and meadows. Due to their tame nature, they are a predator favourite since it requires barely any hunting other than tracking down these mid-sized animals.\r\n\r\nHowever, this same tame nature made it very easy for the people of Eshil to domesticate these hamsters, as they make excellent pets for kids and are a reliable source for insulation fur. When the phurrick becomes too old to produce quality fur, they're brought to the slaughterhouse to be served up in stews across the region.\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n[h2]Monstrous: Jeckl Rabbit[/h2]\r\nThe Jeckl Rabbit is one of the more ferocious animals roaming through the vast expanse that is this world. Jeckl Rabbits come in many shapes and sizes depending on the environment they live in. However, there is one trait that defines the Jeckl Rabbit: their jetblack venomous fangs.\r\n\r\nThese rabbits move in flocks of roughly 30 to 50. The males in the flock are split between the hunting pack and the protectors, each alternating one another. While the protectors protect the females and the babies, the hunting pack goes out to bring the meat home. One pack of 14 to 20 hunters can take on large bears, if they really want to.\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n[h2]Danger: Nightshade Butterfly[/h2]\r\nThe Nightshade Butterfly is a seemingly innocent flying insect, but do not be fooled. These butterflies feast on the nectar of the Nightshade. While feasting on the nectar, they also ingest small bits of the poison from the plant through their legs and the nectar itself, making these butterflies poisonous themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Nightshade Butterfly looks a lot like the Daybreak Butterfly, with only very small and subtle differences that are very difficult to spot for non-experts. Seeing as Daybreak Butterflies are a frequently eaten snack among the people of Eshil, it has happened more than once that an avid snacker had to be rushed to a medic in hopes of extracting or counteracting the poison just in time.\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n[h2]BONUS! Toadenor[/h2]\r\nOpera croaking toads!\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n[h2]BONUS! Scarf Tit[/h2]",
