    "content": "Most of the trading done in @[Eshil](location:251eb80c-8462-4cd2-ae93-dbb4ecb74af8) goes through one of the many merchants that operates under the wing of the Limani Supplies Dealer. It is by far the largest organisation in all of @[Illtresi](organization:d5cb649e-a3cd-4a2d-b065-5512783135ef) that is still independent from the country. While their main objective is selling, buying, and trading products, the Limani Dealers make it their mission to give back to the society that has allowed them to grow as big as they have.\r\n\r\n[quote][center][b]Come and join the Limani Supplies Dealer![/b][br][br]\r\nWe have work for everyone of any skillset! Would you rather work with your hands instead of trading? We can certainly use a few extra hands at our child organisation; the shipyard, the vehicle factory, or at the breeding facility! Still nothing there for you? We will make it our mission to provide you with a job that suits your needs.[br][br]\r\nCome and have a chat with us at our headquarters to see what we have to offer![/center]|An advertisement at the Limani Townsboard[/quote]\r\n\r\n[h2]From Pact to Enterprise[/h2]\r\nIn the olden days, before the @[Kingdom of Illtresi](organization:d5cb649e-a3cd-4a2d-b065-5512783135ef) had fully established itself in the region, @[Limani](settlement:4013fda7-abda-4636-b0a8-fd64854d741d) was a small fishing village with a tight and helpful community. To obtain other products, like eggs and meat, two merchants travelled through the region to find other villages so they could trade wares. After a few trades, they setup a trade contract that specified the first exchange rates for the produce. More villages further inland heard about the trading contracts that the Limani merchants were handing out and they wanted to chime in on the deal too. Within a matter of years, the trading contracts between villages and Limani grew exponentially. In order to keep up with the trading demand, the villagers built ships and carriages so they could trade larger numbers of goods. A few merchants noticed that villages also wanted to trade with each other, but did not have the means to transport large numbers. They offered to facilitate the trade in exchange for a fee so they could maintain the transportation equipment.\r\n\r\n[h3]Expanding Business, Increasing Employment Opportunities[/h3]\r\nThe merchants from Limani knew they had found a business with great potential and took the lead in maintaining the trading contract. With that, the Limani Supplies Dealer came to life. The company facilitated trades between villages and kept a fair exchange rate for the several products that come to market. Aside from the trades themselves, they generated a stable income with renting their ships and carriages. To conintue building and maintaining their means of transportation, they setup three new coorporations that continues to provide the services regarding the transportation: @[the Limani Supplier Shipyard](organization:f7381dd5-7629-4a79-b224-817e6af15493) for the ships, @[the Limani Supplier Vehicles](organization:e875ed5d-fad6-4562-a4c3-2501c34cf616) for the carriages, and @[Limani Supplier Breeding Facility](organization:cc0ec670-6cf7-443e-87cf-b5afd6d4f762) for providing the animals that pull the carriages. With these extra companies, they have created a rich employment environment for the villagers and the new people who flocked to the thriving town.\r\n\r\nAs the business continued to grow, the range of products and participating villages also increased. The most notable change was the value of products that were traded. In the olden days, it was just food and produce. However, as the empire grew, more expensive items came into the market. A few times, one of the carriages carrying an expensive item got robbed on the road. After the third time, the Limani Supplies Dealers asked a handful people from the towns militia to travel along with the trade to protect the wares and the people, of course against good pay. Bringing along a squat of bodyguards drastically decreased the number of successful robberies. To keep the town fully protected, the @[Limani Supplier Security Services](formation:68971805-a026-41bd-9154-6e6dd9ddcb71) came to life and dedicated itself to training young men into formidable security guards so they would not have to borrow the towns militia any longer.\r\n\r\n[h3]Befriending a Kingdom[/h3]\r\nThe @[Kingdom of Illtresi](organization:d5cb649e-a3cd-4a2d-b065-5512783135ef) have tried to make the Limani Supplies Dealers and their children companies part of the kingdom itself but to no avail. The Limani Dealers have made it clear that the want to stay independent as trade transcends the boundaries of countries in their opinion. After many back and forth conversations, the two parties came to an agreement. The company could stay independent, but they would have to pledge their allegiance to the kingdom in times of war. Their vehicles and ships ought not to be used by the enemies for the war, only for the trade. Furthermore, they have to help maintain the roads and rivers that they use frequently for the transportation of goods instead. It aliviates the company from paying taxes and allows them to contribute to the thing that they use the most.\r\n\r\nWith the newfound allegiance, the Limani Dealers gained a free pass to setup new locations for their business throughout the country. Nowadays, there are multiple offices, trading outposts, and warehouses scattered all through @[Eshil](location:251eb80c-8462-4cd2-ae93-dbb4ecb74af8).\r\n\r\n[row][col3][h4]Office[/h4][/col3][col3][h4]Trading Outpost[/h4][/col3][col3][h4]Warehouse[/h4][/col3][/row]\r\n[row][col3]The office is the central building for a part of the region that keep all the exchange rates of the products that circulate in the market of that specific subregion. Furthermore, large trading transactions, whether in quantity or in value, must be administered through an office before the trade can take place. An office has a direct line of communication to the headquarters to request all the assets required for the trade. They also provide HQ with a weekly report on all the sales, trades, and services provided.[/col3]\r\n[col3]Trading outposts can be found more frequently and in smaller cities and villages throughout the country. They often include a @[Phoenixery](landmark:d4e250ab-1bef-4552-9b6f-ab8cf23fc7b4) for all the @[WafflePhoenixes](species:e1570f33-4ba3-4948-b5df-22d0edfb3348) and heaps of @[Limani Supplies Dealer Messages](item:0d16f47e-00c0-49fe-beb0-6c468442cb8b) owned by the company to ensure that there is always a ways for community to notify the Limani Dealers of anything they want to sell or buy. If there is no office nearby, they can send their requests for more valuable trades directly to the nearest office.[/col3]\r\n[col3]The warehouse is where the Limani Dealers store their left over stock that they intend to sell later. Wandering merchants can request a space in the warehouse to store their goods until they have found the right purchaser for their items. There are multiple warehouses scattered through @[Eshil](location:251eb80c-8462-4cd2-ae93-dbb4ecb74af8), but their location is not public knowledge. The only one that everyone knows about is the one in @[Limani](settlement:4013fda7-abda-4636-b0a8-fd64854d741d) itself.[/col3][/row]",

You can travel to all corners of the world together. That's part of the job after all. You'll definitely make new friends in and outside of the company.

Come and visit the headquarters for more information or to apply![/center][/aloud][/col]\r\n[col][justify]As masters of their craft, the @[Limani Supplies Merchants](profession:5e33d5a0-cc51-4bf5-8515-131b0c9297a8) offer their knowledge and expertise as a service to other people. The length and depth of the assignment depends on the needs of the client or customer. This service ranges from giving advice on what is best to do with the wares to full on covering the trade of the products.[br][br]\r\nFor simple, often one off assignments, the merchants work based on a commission fee for every trade they do. If they have to provide a consult, they discuss a fair rate with the client. Sometimes this ranges from a few coins, to a large sum. The payment mostly depends on the amount of data presented and the depth of the advice that the client wants. In larger cases, the merchants discuss a payment rate by the hour and keep track of the time they spend on the assignment. It is mostly the rich with a single thing to sell or wanting advice on purchasing or selling properties that inquire about this service.[br][br]\r\nFor the longer assignments, the merchants most often use full contracts dictating the services they will provide and the costs. These contracts also include an extra clause for overtime, availability, and the merchants assigned to the job. Farmers who want to sell their harvest on a market, but cannot affort to leave the farm or have the means to transport their produce, are the target audience for this service. Another group are manufacturers of products who want to conduct the sales of their products through the Limani Dealers. The enormous trading network is a goldmine for potential customers which makes the fee worth it. Some manufacturers or solo workshop owners employ the service to find the best purchaser for their end product.[/justify][/col][/row]\r\n\r\n[row][col][h3]Transport Services[/h3][/col][col] [/col][/row]\r\n[row][col][justify]Where there is trade, there is transportation and therefore the transportation service and the trading service provided by the Limani Supplies Dealers often go hand in hand. Sometimes, the merchants offer both services as a package deal. The company has a large fleet of ships and vehicles that continuously travel through the region to deliver goods for their trades, so they might as well take someone else's trade and deliver it at their doorstep if they ride past. Still, transporting large amounts of product requires a crew bring it all to its destination safely.[br][br]\r\nHowever, the transport services are not exclusive to the trading business. Private individuals lean upon the service to deliver packages and messages to friends and family in other villages. Smaller packages and messages are delivered using a @[WafflePhoenix](species:e1570f33-4ba3-4948-b5df-22d0edfb3348), sometimes with a @[Limani Supplies Dealer Messages](item:0d16f47e-00c0-49fe-beb0-6c468442cb8b) attached to it. When they believe the value of their package is high, they can make use of the @[Limani Supplier Security Services](formation:68971805-a026-41bd-9154-6e6dd9ddcb71) to ensure the safety of the transport throughout its journey.[br][br]\r\nAnother target audience for the transport services are the people themselves. Many want to travel to other cities or villages to visit their relatives or acquaintances, or simply to explore the region. Many merchants also have to travel, and that's where the transport service comes into play. For a small fee, which depends on the method of transportation, one can ride along with a merchant to their desired destination or close to it. After seeing the success of this concept, the @[Limani Supplier Shipyard](organization:f7381dd5-7629-4a79-b224-817e6af15493) built a few ferries that allows large groups of people and merchants alike to travel to the large port cities. The @[Limani Supplier Vehicles](organization:e875ed5d-fad6-4562-a4c3-2501c34cf616) built grand carriages to transport people over land to the big cities stopping at villages that they happen to pass through.[/justify][/col]\r\n[col][aloud][center][b]We're looking for Couriers, Chauffeurs, and Ferry Captains![/b][br]\r\n[br]\r\nWould you like to travel the world while delivering trading goods to our customers?

Come and visit the headquarters for more information or to apply!\r\n[/center][/aloud][/col]\r\n[col][justify]The Limani Dealers trade with a great many items that they do not always sell the same day. They have large warehouses to store their stock and keep track of it. The @[Wandering Merchants](profession:b886db16-9b1b-4940-b1b5-eeec896a91ed) of the Limani Supplies Dealers have a storage space in the warehouse closest to them for free, since they work for the comany. The merchants, wandering or not, often store their wares to wait for a better market value. Sometimes they temporarily store a trading item for a buyer that has already purchased it. The reason could be that the merchant hasn't had time yet to send out the item with a courier, or that they have to wait for a security squat to arrive to travel in a convoy.[br][br]\r\nAs prepared as they are, the Limani Supplies Dealer warehouses are enormous which often leaves them with much empty space. In an attempt to not let it go to waste, they rent storage space in their warehouses to private individuals. Depending on the size and duration, the merchants set up a contract with a corresponding fee. Most often, people rent small spaces to store their valuables. However, some of the richer people use it as a storage compartment for a large portion of their property or to as a central place for their trading wares. The latter is especially useful, as it gives the merchants that are under their contract direct access to it to perform their assignments.[br][br]\r\nOne of the most prominent features of the warehouses that makes them a very popular service is their immaculate protection. The warehouse in @[Limani](settlement:4013fda7-abda-4636-b0a8-fd64854d741d) is the only publicly known warehouse and still its exact location is a well kept secret. The location of all the other warehouses are strictly on a need-to-know-basis. Therefore, only the people working at a warehouse and the ones having a storage space there know where the entrance is. If the hidden location doesn't already scream security, the Limani Supplies Dealers wanted to make absolutely sure that the chance of goods getting stolen is at a minimum. @[Security Specialists](profession:c1a93f0b-927b-42bf-88cc-ee6be1aa6b69) provided by the @[Limani Supplier Security Services](formation:68971805-a026-41bd-9154-6e6dd9ddcb71) are present at each facility at all times to ensure only authorised people gain access to the store spaces. There is speculation that other defense systems are also in place, but no one has dared to verify that information yet.[/justify][/col][/row]\r\n\r\n[container:spoilsahead][container:spoilcontent][row][col][h3]Sniffer Services[/h3][/col][col] [/col][/row]\r\n[row][col]The real reason behind the immense success of the Limani Supplies Dealers doesn't lie with their merchants. It is the @[Sniffers](profession:efa8099e-842c-456b-ac17-498a6c4e7862) that have provided the merchants with the information to make incredible trades. Sniffers are the people that go out into the markets to find good deals before anyone else has seen them and tip off the company to make the purchase. They are the real brains behind the operation. Only people very close to the Limani Supplies Dealers are aware of the existence of the sniffers and sometimes employ their services for themselves. They use them to find very specific items that are hard to find, or to be notified of certain objects coming into market soon.[br][br]\r\nSniffers will never do the purchase themselves for their employers or even for the company. The most they will do is secure the price and tell the seller that someone else will come to their establishment to complete the trade. The primary reason for this behaviour is to avoid giving away that they work for the Limani Supplies Dealer. Once the seller is aware that they work for the company, they instantly increase their selling prices and that is precisely what they are trying to avoid.[br][br]\r\nMost sniffers are very shy, but intelligent people. They have a keen knowledge on what is going on in the market at all times and therefore are like a walking catalogue. They know the value of products and can accurately predict how much profit they can make from a trade with a certain product. The Limani Supplies Dealers are always on the lookout for more sniffers, but they do not openly search for them.[/col]\r\n[col][aloud][center][b]Company Notice: New Openings for the Sniffer Program[/b][br]\r\n[br]\r\nWe have once again a few opening for the sniffer program. With our company and influence radius growing, we're looking for more people to get us in on interesting deals.[br]\r\n[br]\r\nSniffers are the heart and soul of the Limani Supplies Dealer. Do you think you have what it takes?[br]\r\n[br]\r\nWe ask for applicants to have at least [i]some[/i] experience as a merchant. You do not need to know the ins and outs of the field, because most of that knowledge will be replaced as a sniffer.[br]\r\n[br]\r\n[i]What will we offer you?[/i]\r\n[ul][li]Excellent pay, of course! You will be away a lot for work, so we will generously compensate you for the time you have to spend away from home and family. You will have access to your own WafflePhoenix courtesy of us, so you have a safe means of communication.[/li]\r\n[li]An extensive training program that will push your boundaries and transform you in an excellent covert merchant. We will assign you a sniffer mentor with whom you will spend a lot of time perfecting this fine art.[/li][/ul]\r\nCurious? Contact the Sniffer department with your application!\r\n[/center][/aloud][/col]\r\n[/row][/container]\r\n[container:spoilwarning]Contains Secret!

Also having a catchy slogan is fun to read and grabbed my attention. Great job sharing what an advertisement would look like. These will create great adventure hooks for if/when adventurers decide to join a service group.\r\nFor the initial advertisement at the top, I think another section of the document may look better for it, either at the very top to pull readers in before the initial text, or right before the services section to hype the reader up for all the different services offered. Because I love pronouncing words in general, something to consider is if you want a unique name to sound a specific way, add a pronunciation so the reader know what it should/ you would like it to sounds like (this feedback of course depends on if you care what the reader thinks the word sounds like). Lastly when you used the word phoenixery, I did not have enough context to what the word all entailed. If I had to guess, it means a place to trade or hold goods? xD\r\nHopefully this feedback helps. Thanks for the great read!"
