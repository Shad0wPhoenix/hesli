    "content": "As you wander through the world, you'll come across a great many people. Different clans, nations, people, and cultures, it stands at the heart of Hesli. Your interaction with these groups determines the things you can do. From the smallest scale of your behaviour towards the tavern owner to completing quests for a kingdom, you build a reputation with each interaction with that individual or organisation. It can go multiple ways; if you treat the tavern owner respectfully, you might get a discount on your sleeping accommodation. On the other hand, treat them poorly, and you might end up paying more than usual or even unwelcome to stay at all.\r\n\r\n[h2]Rewards and Penalties of Your Reputation[/h2]\r\nGood behaviour and helping out communities in need increases your reputation for the better with that specific group or individual. The opposite earns you a bad reputation. However, be mindful of the customs and traditions of the cultures you visit. Something that might be normal and acceptable for one can be taboo or strictly forbidden for another.\r\n\r\nSo, what can you do with the reputation that you build up during your journey? There is a variety of things that it influences. As stated, you can get discounts from shops and taverns with a good reputation, but there is more. You can unlock character and faction-exclusive quests, locations, items, and even people. You might get invited to traditions and events as an honoured guest. Most importantly, your reputation directly contributes to the influence you can exert over people. With a poor reputation, a call to arms might not be answered, or a dire warning may not be taken seriously.\r\n\r\n[quote]It takes many good deeds to build a good reputation, and only one bad one to lose it.|Benjamin Franklin[/quote]\r\n\r\nA bad reputation makes life more difficult and varies from one place to another. The penalties can depend on your previous actions that have made you notorious. For example, if you steal from the poor, the rich might steal your belongings or coin. Killing innocents makes guards more alert to your every move when wandering through town. Beware of the relations between clans, villages, and nations. Your actions from one town can alert another, and they might take pre-emptive measures to keep their people safe.",

By allocating points, you can modify a player's reputation and choose their renown tier. This part of the article outlines the two primary mechanics of the system: how you can reward or reprimand your players for their actions and behaviour during the game and how their renown level can influence what they can and cannot do.\r\n\r\n[h2]Designating Reputation Points[/h2]\r\nIn this game, players have the opportunity to earn valuable reputation points through various interactions with non-playable characters (NPCs) and organisations. These points serve as a reward for players who take the time to explore the city and engage in positive behaviour towards others. By cultivating strong relationships with NPCs, such as a friendly bartender, players can gain access to sensitive information that can aid them in their gameplay journey.\r\n\r\nThe number of reputation points awarded for each interaction varies depending on the type of interaction. Quests typically yield a higher number of points, while social interactions provide a more modest amount. However, even small social interactions can accumulate over time, encouraging players to engage with NPCs on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the game's objective is to foster a sense of community in the face of a tragedy. The friendships that players cultivate throughout the game will prove to be invaluable resources when they are needed most. By building positive relationships with NPCs and organisations, players will be better equipped to overcome the challenges that lie ahead.\r\n\r\n[container:col-md-4 right][aloud][h3]Intent and Reasoning[/h3]\r\nWhen it comes to campaigns or novels, it's important to focus on two themes: connection and consequences. That's where the reputation system comes in. It's designed to discourage players from adopting a \"shoot first, think second\" mentality and instead encourage them to stay in touch with the friends they've made, remain loyal, and use their influence to resolve conflicts between factions that would otherwise be impossible to overcome.[/aloud][/container]\r\n[h3]Social Interaction[/h3]\r\nSocial interaction is a significant aspect of the game's roleplay. Players must consider how they treat NPCs, including bartenders, shopkeepers, villagers, and even cultural customs. The way they converse with prominent figures like village elders can also affect their reputation.\r\n\r\nThese social interactions should give the least amount of points. However, these points will rack up quickly since they happen often. A party will have to do some shopping, they'll have to stay at taverns, and interact with people while on their quest to get the information they need to find the missing children.\r\n\r\nPositive interactions with NPCs can earn players anywhere from 0 to 5 reputation points. However, more influential moments, such as delivering a speech to convince the king to send troops, can earn players more points based on the significance of the interaction.\r\n\r\nHere are a few examples of social interactions at various scales and how many points the players can earn.\r\n\r\n0-5 points: Treat bartenders and shopkeepers respectfully with every purchase or conversation they make.[br]\r\n10 - 20 points: Breaking up a fight in the middle of a busy plaza.[br]\r\n50 - 100 points: Persuading someone higher up to take action.\r\n\r\n[container:col-md-4 left][aloud][h3]Negative Bias[/h3]\r\nIt is possible to subtract points from players who exhibit negative behaviour. However, it is important to be aware of the negative bias in these situations. Negative experiences can significantly reduce trust, while building it is a gradual process. To determine the appropriate deduction, a good rule of thumb is to subtract five times the points that would have been given for a positive interaction, considering the seriousness of the behaviour.[/aloud][/container]\r\n[h3]Quest Interaction[/h3]\r\nUndertaking a quest from an organisation can be more time-consuming compared to simply interacting with a bartender. Throughout the journey, players make decisions and take action to fulfil the request of their quest giver. The size and scale of the inquiry may involve multiple minor tasks leading up to the main story beat. \r\n\r\nThis means there are multiple ways of completing a quest, which will determine how that will affect their reputation. The decision that the party, or one player of the party, makes and the outcome will determine how many points they are awarded. For example, the quest was to deliver the letter without looking at its contents. However, one of the party members decided to have a look anyway, and this was discovered by the recipient of the letter. While the quest has been completed, the catch is reflected in the reputation they receive for completing the quest. \r\n\r\nMore significant quests, especially the main plot beats, will give many reputation points. Smaller ones, just like interactions, will provide less, but often many can be done. Some can even be considered daily quests. The plot articles containing the quest will have a box with possible outcomes and the corresponding amount of reputation points you can award your players. Of course, it is ultimately up to you if you want to change anything; these reputation boxes are meant to help you determine how many reputation points to give to your players.\r\n\r\n[h2]Renown Tiers[/h2]\r\nThe reputation tiers indicate a player's status in relation to an NPC or organisation. Depending on this level, you can decide how to respond to the player and their requests. Achieving a specific reputation tier or higher may grant access to new information and quests.\r\n\r\n[container:rep floatRight]\r\n[b]Reputation Tiers[/b][br][container:repTier]\r\n[row][col]Advisor[/col][col]xxxxx[/col][/row]\r\n[row][col]Hero[/col][col]xxxxx[/col][/row]\r\n[row][col]Family[/col][col]xxxxx[/col][/row]\r\n[row][col]Acquaintance[/col][col]xxxxx[/col][/row]\r\n[row][col]Friendly[/col][col]xxxxx[/col][/row]\r\n[row][col]Neutral[/col][col]xxxxx[/col][/row]\r\n[row][col]Unfriendly[/col][col]xxxxx[/col][/row]\r\n[row][col]Rebel[/col][col]xxxxx[/col][/row]\r\n[row][col]Dishonoured[/col][col]xxxxx[/col][/row]\r\n[row][col]Hatred[/col][col]xxxxx[/col][/row]\r\n[row][col]Enemy[/col][col]xxxxx[/col][/row]\r\n[/container][/container]There are a total of 11 reputation levels, with 5 positive, 5 negative, and one neutral level. Every player starts at neutral (0 points) and progresses from there. This broad range provides numerous opportunities for players to advance along the tiers and enjoy the game. The higher a player's positive reputation level, the more information and exclusive content they will receive. Conversely, a higher negative reputation level will result in more hostile reactions from people, potentially leading to outright attacks.\r\n\r\nThe number of points required for each level of reputation is not predetermined. Each NPC and organisation has its own set of points designated for each tier. In applicable articles, the box on the right will be visible to GameMasters containing the reputation information for that specific NPC or organisation.\r\n\r\nRemember that reputation levels are assigned to individual players, not entire parties. When accessing exclusive quests or information, GameMasters must determine whether an organisation is willing to share that information with the whole group. Generally, at least half of the members should have the required reputation tier. When a player's reputation is lower by more than one tier, the organisation is likelier to keep the information and quest private. Players can leave that one player behind when obtaining the data to work around this issue. Any differences in the threshold will be noted in the article.\r\n[/subcontainer]",
