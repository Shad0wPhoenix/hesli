    "content": "Clucking alongside the roads or roaming through the meadows, chickons are a most harmless feathery friend to all. They stand at a relatively massive height of 150cm (or 5\"), making them one of the larger non-predatory bird to walk around. Young kids love to ride them, and some of the smaller species, like Gnomes and Halflings, use them as permanent mounts.\r\n\r\nEven though the chickon has wings, these are too short to make the animal effectively airborne. Sure, they can fly small distances to get up in a tree when fleeing from predators or for a very rough glide of a cliff for a safe landing. Other than that, they keep their feet firm on the ground, picking at seeds and fruits from various trees and bushes.\r\n\r\nChickons lay eggs year round, which is a staple in the diet of many people. The eggs are a means of reproduction, but only become fertile after chickons mate with a rooster. When fertilized, the chickon will brood on her eggs until they hatch, which usually takes roughly four weeks. Compared to their parents, the chicks are teeny tiny, merely the size of a human hand. However, within the span of three months, they grow into full sized chickons and roosters.\r\n\r\nEspecially the husbandries in the gardens of bermuth breed the chickons as a food source. The eggs can be eaten as is. After five years, a chickon is too old to continue producing eggs effectively. The husbandries will bring these birds to the slaughterhouse along with the ones that are not up to the husbandry standards. Its meat is rich in protein, minerals and vitamins. One chickon can feed up to ten people for a week which makes them an excellent and efficient source of food.\r\n\r\nThere are many varieties of chickons roaming the world. The Mazurka Chickon is the most common chickon. Its name derived from the place where it was discovered, the Mazurka Hills. The Bermuth Chickon is a special variety of the bird. After, too much, inbreeding by one of the husbandries in Limani, the chickons comb and wattle changed colour from the standard red, to bright green. It is believed that the red pigment got blocked which makes for its unique appearance. In order parts of the world, the chickon varies in colour but only the feathers which makes the Bermuth Chickon such a unique exception. Nowadays, these chickons have become the staple in the industry.\r\n\r\nThe War Chickons (BATTLEROOSTERS!) of the Gwenash are a special breed of chickon. Forged in the fires of war, the gwenash gnomes have trained their chickons relentlessly and started breeding their best stock in order to create even better chickons. These birds carry up to two gnomes into the battlefield. Custom armour plates protect their vital organs, but it does render them entirely flightless.\r\nStill, a trampling horde of chickons ridden by equally headless (not literally) gnomes has put fear in the hearts of many enemies. Even those that stand taller than the chickons are not fond of getting picked and plucked at by the animals.\r\n\r\nWhile many chickons are used in challenging environments, whether that is in battle or in the breeding facilities for food production, a large number still roam the plains of the world freely. They feed on seeds and seedlings during the colder months. When summer arrives and fruits appear on the trees and bushes, they happily pick after the tastiest berries and fruits. Bussle berries are their absolute favourite, and they will come charging at you when you keep a handful out for them.\r\nThe chickon is a means of balance for the plants. By eating the seed and seedlings, they keep the plants in check and prevent overgrowth. Munching on the berries and fruits ensures that their seeds get spread through the chickons droppings. They stand at the heart of an ecological cycle.\r\n\r\nFor many children, chickons are one of their first pets. The gentle nature of the bird makes them trainable, but also pose no danger to kids. The worst that could happen is getting plucked at, but a child really needs to annoy a chickon to be met with that fate. Otherwise, they make the perfect first companion. Parents teach their children how to care for animals and meet their basic needs. With the chickon being relatively low maintenance, it is the perfect starter animal. And the most fun part? Kids can ride them endlessly. Chickon racing is one of the favourite activities and serves as a perfect bonding opportunity between kids and parents alike.",
