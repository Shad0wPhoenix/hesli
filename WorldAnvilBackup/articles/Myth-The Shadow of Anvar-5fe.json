    "content": "In the dark forest near @[Havalla](settlement:677004fe-fc11-454f-86e7-14ce6f8af81d) is the @[Tower of Anvar](landmark:a62d249a-b0d3-47ac-8612-65656510dfa7). It once was the home of @[Archmage Anvar](person:6396b2eb-863a-4d94-bf58-34c4646d4196), a teacher and practitioner of dark magic. However, after years of terror, a group of adventurers finally took him to his grave with them. No one knows what came of his students. Still, people wondering these forests sometimes feel a presence, as if this great mage never truly left the world of the living.\r\n\r\n[quote]Don't ever go in that dark forest, something fishy goes on in there. I swear, I saw trees walking and rocks moving about. Even bodies! Someone is controlling the environment like puppets. But you know what's the worst? I saw a shadow in human form behind everything that moved. [i]And it looked me dead in the eye.[/i] I'm telling you, don't go there, it's haunted.[/quote]\r\n\r\nMultiple people claim to have seen a shadow when they were wandering the forests. Most of the time, it is ghostlike. According to a few wild teens, it wasn't just a shadow. They could see a face and clothes. So far, the shape and look correlates with the distance to the tower. The closer to the tower, the more defined it becomes.\r\n\r\nTwo people have travelled to the tower in search for a thrill, but they never returned. They recorded their adventures and one of their journals was found a few days later close to the tower. It read the following:\r\n\r\n[aloud][u]Dualia Sempt Thorza[/u][br]\r\nWe're going to the Tower of Anvar today! I've heard incredible stories about this place. Our friends told us it is a haunted place, that some phathom is pulling the strings and scaring people. Of course, that's all probably a lie to keep up from entering the tower. Who knows what books about dark magic we can find there? I'm dying to see some creepy reincarnation spells of sorts and learn about all that stuff.\r\n\r\n[u]Trialia Sempt Thorza[/u][br]\r\nBartus and I have set up camp close to the tower. It was quite the walk out here and navigating this dark forest is no easy feat. There's definitely something out there, but we haven't seen this shadow that everyone keeps warning us about. For now, we're going to sleep here and have a good rest, so we have all day tomorrow to explore the surroundings and the tower. Come on, Anvar, where are you at, hmm?[/aloud]",
