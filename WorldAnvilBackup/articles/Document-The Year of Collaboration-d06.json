    "contents": "[quote][h1]The Year of Collaboration[/h1]\r\n\r\nA few centuries ago, I arrived on this landmass inhabited by dragons. They call it Heimr or Ormsliki, but I cal it Hejoslika to shorten it a bit. One of them recorded the start of this world on paper: The Day of the Rising Sun. It is fascinating to think that they have created this entire world on their own, or at least reshaped it. They meticulously care for their preferred elements and tasks in an attempt to balance the animals, plants, lands and seas.\r\n\r\nHowever, I also see intelligent creatures wandering this world. The dragons have learned them how to use tools, how to grow crop, and mine coal for heat. These tiny... things, for a lack of better word, are more capable of maintaining parts of the world that require precision work. Us dragons are strong, but finesse is not our way because our claws do not allow us. These tiny things, on the other hand, can use tools to do the precision work. However, I can understand their hesitance in using these creatures to do part of their work. Maybe I can sway a few to give it a try and see how it goes.\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\nToday, I have spoken to the dragons and asked them about these small creatures wandering their world. I wanted to know who they are, and how they came to be. Apparently, the gold dragons have created them to give the world more intelligent and sapient life. While these creatures are intelligent and have a mind of their own, the dragons label them as inferior. The tiny things are nowhere near their mental capacity and thus are not good enough to be part of the community.\r\n\r\nHowever, I made them see the potenial in the lifeforms. While not as intelligent as us, they are able to use tools because the dragons taught them. Since they also live on this world, why not work together to maintain it? Let them do the precision work, while the dragons perform the heavy duty tasks. In return, we should protect them with our might. Teach them more, learn them to read, write, and speak so we can communicate more effectively. \r\n\r\nAs I expected, the dragons were quite hesitant about the idea. However, a few of them saw the potential of this collaboration. They implemented it first, choosing as their collaborators these hairy creatures; I mean, they have hair growing on their scalp, cheeks, and skin from what I can see on the outside and I surely don't want to know what's more beneath their clothing. The dragons have them pickaxes to start digging and mining the mountains. Any valuable materials, the dragons kept and the rest was for the creatures. They maintained the mountains that way.\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\nIt has been some time since I spoke to the dragons with my idea for collaboration with the sapient life on this landmass. The hairy creatures, or Dvares as the dragons call them, have been maintaining the mountains very well. They have set an example for the rest of the dragons, how have now begun to use the other sapient lives. The blue dragons use the tiniest creatures I have ever seen; Geenoms, and they are even smaller than a hatched wrymling! The gold dragons use the slender figures from the woods with their pointy ears, Aileves. While the silver dragons have been searching for a suitable helper, they only found a lifeform in caves that looked like a mix of the Dvares and Aileves. They did not look too intelligent and could not work with any tools, so the dragons let them be.\r\n\r\nI hope that using these little helpers will allow us to live long on this world. It gets more beautiful with every day.|Luna\r\n\r\n[/quote]",
