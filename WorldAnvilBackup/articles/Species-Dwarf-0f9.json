I think there will be more to it than size only; it's also about how one takes care of their beard. Do they braid it nicely, is it combed daily, do they use special lotions to keep it silky smooth. So, faking it would be very difficult... Unless people make beard \"wigs\". :o A counterfeit beard, would that be interesting to add?\r\nOh and uhm... 00ps ^,^\""
