This was very neatly done and I fully believe that the relationship between the dwarves, the mushrooms, and the mountains has some very fun possibilities. I especially like that the elves poke fun at the dwarves for their fear, rather neatly poking holes in the fabric of their own prideful reality. Thanks for sharing. :)"

    "summary": "Far back, in the ancient days of the world, it was a tumultuous time. The land was being shaped, the waters being directed, and the people were fighting with one another.\r\n\r\nDwarfs learned early on to trust the mountains with their lives as it has saved them many times before. However, one day, it began to sing... Music came from the mountains all over the planet. The dwarfs had no idea what was happening. A few days later, a volcano erupted, covering the lands with lava and killing everything in its path.\r\n\r\nSince then and to this day, the dwarfs associate anything in nature that sings as a sign of devastation and disaster. The only exception they have made over the centuries, is that beings with a visible mouth can sing without bringing disaster upon society.",
    "historicalbasis": "There is historical evidence of the massive volcano erruption that has happened in ancient days. However, it is more likely that many of the volcanoes in @[The Atlassian](location:4ab03cd2-c770-4e36-b575-52cd6cf942d9) have errupted at nearly the same moment. Historians have been able to determine that a few of these volcanoes have grown immensely by this event, as the magma stolled and therefore widened the cliffside.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the extremely fertile soil of the @[Arlingfell Grasshills](location:34bfefac-f570-4b41-846d-eb4dd5523b27) are a direct result of the eruptions. The lava covered the meadows. It broke down over time, turning into the most fertile soil found on the planet. According to both historians and antropologists, that can only be achieved when massive amounts of lava pour over the lands which links the erruptions of the volcanoes in the Atlassian.\r\n\r\nThe only part that has left the professionals scratching the back of their heads is the singing part of the myth. Thus far, they haven't been able to properly record and reproduce the sound that the dwarfs claim to hear.",
    "spread": "Every dwarf has heard the tales of the singing mountains as a child. This myth is a more child friendly version of the original, but is still packs enough punch to properly scare the dwarfish children. Parents sometimes use it to instill fear in their child as punishment, and to teach them to listen whether it is to themselves or to the mountains. As the children grow older, they come to understand the true meaning of the myth better.\r\n\r\nIt has become so common, that the tales have made their way outside Dwarfish territory. Especially @[high elves](species:94de1f60-4310-4c78-b3f6-4db374ee8ba4) like to use this myth to mock the dwarf whenever they enter an eerie mountain. The humans are still very sceptical about the entire thing, but they leave it up to the dwarfs to interpret it in whatever way they want.",
    "variations": "Over time, the dwarfs encountered the @[Blipplerip](species:3707ea8f-7303-47fa-9d51-276925d126ad) attached to the rocks of the mountains. Not much is known about these little mushrooms. However, they seem to produce the same type of singing sounds that the dwarfs know from the mountains. Combined with the lack of a visible mouth, and the dwarfs started thinking that these mushrooms essentially conveyed the will of the mountain.",
