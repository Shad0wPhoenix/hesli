The people of @[The Dwarven Mining Enterprise](organization:7da5d532-16b7-402d-bafe-8d582ca2a777) with the help of the @[Kingdom of Illtresi](organization:d5cb649e-a3cd-4a2d-b065-5512783135ef) poured in their best efforts to come to a peaceful solution with the dwarves. However, the @[Haldir](ethnicity:cd79c677-c98e-4580-9153-d36718c557b6), already driven mad by the lack of @[Zedonias](material:6a929cbe-43da-49d2-8bc7-cded09522f24), took their frenzy to the streets of the town forcing the hands of all the parties involved.\r\n\r\n[quote]These.. decaying dwarfs look scary. They want the Zedonias all to themselves, but we cannot allow for that to happen. We offered them other goods and aid, but it seems like they are deaf to all our proposals. It is as if there is more it than they are willing to let on. Why are they so reliant on the Zedonias? Either way, I hope we can keep the city safe...|Snippet from the first report on the Haldir Frenzies[/quote]\r\n\r\n[h2]Missing Investigators[/h2]\r\nDuring the excavation of @[Zedonias](material:6a929cbe-43da-49d2-8bc7-cded09522f24), a few @[miners](profession:b8855c87-1d5a-4849-bfbe-a8695354ac02) from the Mining Enterprise noticed that the number of calcified eggs in the lair decreased at a faster rate than they were digging up, so they informed the company. In response, a small team of investigators set out to the lair and deeper into the mountains to find the cause of the disappearance. After ten days, none of them had returned.\r\n\r\nWorried about their employees, @[The Dwarven Mining Enterprise](organization:7da5d532-16b7-402d-bafe-8d582ca2a777) sent another group of investigators into the mountains, this time accompanied by a squat from the @[Limani Supplier Security Services](formation:68971805-a026-41bd-9154-6e6dd9ddcb71) for their protection. What they found was not a pleasant sight..\r\n\r\n[quote]We found them... I've taken their personal belonging and put them together for each investigator, so we can bring it back to the family. There is... let's just say there's not much left of the bodies. Whoever did this can consider themselves monsters, who can do something like that to a fellow dwarf?!|Snippet from the Diary of Thannik, one of the security guards from the Limani Supplier Security Services[/quote]\r\n\r\nThe second group got safely back with their report of what they found in the mountains, including their suspicions of the people responsible. With this knowledge in mind, especially what they had done to the first group of investigators, the company called in a close ally of the city: the @[Kingdom of Illtresi](organization:d5cb649e-a3cd-4a2d-b065-5512783135ef).\r\n\r\n[quote]Sortly after we had begun our operation, the Haldir must have noticed that their supply of Zedonias reduced rapidly. We suspect that they likely have sent scouts to have a look, just like we sent our investigators, and the two groups have met somewhere in the middle.|Snippet from Thanniks report[/quote]",

As the days passed, they grew increasingly more aggressive. Their faces turned darker, eyes saw literally red, and their lengthened finger nails became pointy like claws. Slowly, the Haldir wandered off in the direction where the Zedonias were being taken, almost as if they could smell the objects through the caverns. Eventually, the dwarves dodder outside where they laid eyes on @[Matona](settlement:ed81f438-3853-4cff-85f2-5b7e233024b1) for the first time. Steadfast, they continued to walk towards the big town, but no one could explain why.\r\n\r\nThe people of Matona had no idea what was happening. A strange group of straggled dwarfs poured into the streets, aimlessly looking around. Out of nowhere, one of the members started thrashing. A form of magic seeped out of its fingertips, setting houses ablaze. Soon, more Haldir entered the same frenzied state of mind until all of them were turned. They attacked any person in sight, anything that moved, anything that looked shiny.\r\n\r\nThe city militia was taken by surprise during the first wave of attacks. They scrambled together as fast as they could to drive back the frenzied Haldir, while also sending out two messengers. The first going to the Kingdom army in the mines and the second going to the establishment of the @[The Dwarven Mining Enterprise](organization:7da5d532-16b7-402d-bafe-8d582ca2a777) informing them of the outbreak and to ask for reinforcements. A few of security men from the @[Limani Supplier Security Services](formation:68971805-a026-41bd-9154-6e6dd9ddcb71) who were still in town, gave the militia an extra helping hand until the army arrived.\r\n\r\nCountless villagers died during this first wave as the city militia was pulling itself together. However, with the help of the army and the security service men, they quickly drove the Haldir back to the mountains. With every subsequent wave, the number of Haldir dwindled slowly but surely until they had rid the mines of all the decayed dwarfs.",
