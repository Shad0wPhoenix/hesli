    "content": "The Haldir used to be a clan of proud @[Dwarfs](species:5e5920f9-06fd-4628-9838-4028f0b01f84) living in the deepest caves of @[Greze Urngorr](location:ff1fbd3f-81e5-49c5-a8d5-0ab957a265ed). A few documents lost to time indicate that these dwarfs lived there for millenia, and were capable of using very advanced magic. A conflict between them and the @[Mandri](ethnicity:f88ac197-2b7f-4ade-9087-4a509077435e) combined with the @[Kingdom of Illtresi](organization:d5cb649e-a3cd-4a2d-b065-5512783135ef) about the @[Zedonias](material:6a929cbe-43da-49d2-8bc7-cded09522f24) has dwindled their numbers immensely to the point of extinction. However, rumours tell of outside forces have caused these dwarfs to fall astray.\r\n\r\n[quote]The Haldir were a formidable enemy. Their magic is clearly more advanced than we initially realised, although we have no idea [i]why[/i]. Some were shooting black fire from their fingertips, and others managed to create poison puddles that ate away the flesh from ones bones. If the kingdom hadn't sent those extra soldier and mages, we wouldn't have stood a chance against them...|A snippet from a report from the first wave of the Haldir Frenzies[/quote]\r\n\r\nThere isn't much information available to the public about the Haldir. Most people nowadays know what has been taught in school and from what they know of the @[Haldir Frenzies](militaryConflict:30e470c3-d63b-4866-871d-23f5d547ef1e). Ever since the conflict, no one has come across any Haldir in the mountains. So, people believe them to be extinct.\r\n\r\nA few dwarfs claim to have found a handful of Haldir still roaming the mountain. They went looking for them after the conflict to find out the truth, because they couldn't believe why the kingdom and @[the city](settlement:ed81f438-3853-4cff-85f2-5b7e233024b1) wouldn't share the Zedonias with them. These dwarfs found that the Haldir used raw Zedonias as a source of food. Outraged that the kingdom would oppress a clan by taking away their source of food, the dwarfs left the city to help out their decaying brethren. No one has heard from them since.\r\n\r\n[row][col][aloud]My dear Amberlig,[br]\r\n[br]\r\nI have found our long lost brothers in the mountains.[br]\r\nThey feasted on the raw Zedonia I stole from HQ and perked right up.[br]\r\nThe anger and rage inside me is overwhelming, how could the kingdom do this?![br]\r\nThey took their food. [i]Their [b]FOOD[/b][/i].[br]\r\nThis is downright appalling. I am going to help these brothers get back on their feet.[br]\r\nLet me know when there's a new Zedonia to steal.[br]\r\n[br]\r\nLove, Erikdroun[/aloud][/col]\r\n[col][aloud]My dear Amberlig,[br]\r\n[br]\r\nI feasted along with my brothers on the Zedonia.. it tastes so good![br]\r\nIt fills me with warmth, but also with more rage for what Illtresi has done to them.[br]\r\nYou should come down with me and live here, it's where we were meant to live.[br]\r\nWe shouldn't slave away for the sake of the city.[br]\r\n[br]\r\nPlease, I want to see you again and show you this place.[br]\r\n[br]\r\nLove, Erikdroun[/aloud][/col][/row]\r\n\r\n[container:spoilsahead]\r\n[container:spoilcontent]\r\n[h2]Unknown History[/h2]\r\nThe Haldir go back a long time, when the dragons were still roaming the world. They had allied themselves with the black dragons during @[The Draconic War](document:59bb8ea4-4e1f-4d47-9d3b-6761de8ac899) to fight against the other dragons and species alongside them. The Haldir, being dwarfs, successfully infiltrated other dwarven clans and sabotaged them. These dwarven spies ratted out the other clans to the black dragons who would swoop in and burn everything to the ground.\r\n\r\nTo make sure that the Haldir wouldn't turn on the black dragons, every member had to prove their loyalty by drinking dragons blood. It gave them enhanced magical abilities, but at a price; they would need to continuously sustain the level of dragon blood to keep it. If done well, they keep the enhancements without too many repercussions. However, during the war, the Haldir drank the blood of fallen draconic bretheren every chance they got. They hoped it would enhance their magical abilities even further. While it did so to a certain extend, it also caused the dwarfs to become reliant on the blood to function properly.\r\n\r\nAfter the war was lost, the Haldir retreated deep into the mountains in hopes they wouldn't be found by the remaining surviving dwarfs. Quickly, they noticed they had become addicted to the draconic substance they feasted on amid the chaos of war. The first few dwarves were decaying and showing signs of immense hunger while losing control of their magic. By a miracle, they stumbled upon a @[Zedonia](material:6a929cbe-43da-49d2-8bc7-cded09522f24) in the depths of caverns and immediately recognised it as a dragon egg. Without hesitation, the Haldir were consuming these eggs as an alternative way to sustain their addiction. The decaying dwarfs went into a frenzy when they saw the Zedonias, thrashing about to the point of killing their brothers.\r\n\r\nThere weren't many Zedonias around that they knew of, which led to many gruesome fights amongst the dwarfs. Their numbers dwindled quicky from a strong 3000 dwarfs to a meager 100 to 150. Still, the Haldir were able to sustain this population with the eggs they had found in the mountain, until they came across the @[Mandri](ethnicity:f88ac197-2b7f-4ade-9087-4a509077435e). After the @[Haldir Frenzies](militaryConflict:30e470c3-d63b-4866-871d-23f5d547ef1e), they were all believed to have died.\r\n\r\nHowever, a few lost and decayed souls still wander in the deepest lairs of the mountains, waiting for a new opportunity.\r\n[/container]\r\n[container:spoilwarning]Tread carefully![br][br]Contains Secrets![/container][/container]",
