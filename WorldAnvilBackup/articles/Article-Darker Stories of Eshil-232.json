His older sister hurried towards him and took Leo by the hand away from the painting.[br]\r\n\"Haven't you heard the stories, you fool?\"[br]\r\n\"What stories?\" Annoyed, he pulled his hand away from his sister's grip. \"What could possibly be wrong with this [b]portrait[/b] that there are [i]stories[/i] about it?\"[br]\r\n\"That, you idiot, is the portrait of Lord Mackerdell,\" Melissa said with a stern voice. \"He was one of the greatest lords in the region. Ruling the lands with an iron fist, he brought prosperity to its citizens. However, there are always people who don't agree with whoever is in charge, and even the invincible Lord Mackerdell was no exception to that rule. It is said that the canvas of this painting was [b]cursed[/b]. The object or person drawn on the canvas would be trapped inside...\"[br]\r\nLeo's eyes widened. \"S~ so Lord M~ Mackerdell is.. trapped in there?\"[br]\r\n\"Indeed. And everyone who touched its frame or the painting will get sucked into the same trap with no [b]escape[/b]...\"[/aloud]\r\n\r\n31. Drown\r\n[aloud]Edwige stormed into the library with a drawing of the plant in her hand.[br]\r\n\"Hello, dear adventurer, please quiet down, you're disturbing the peace of the building.\" The clerk frowned upon the Halfling who's trying to catch her breath. \"Eitherway, how can I help you?\"[br]\r\n\"Hi!\" Edwige took a deep breath and composed herself. \"I was wondering if you have one or more books about the native plants in the Mohari Desert. I'm specifically looking for a plant that looks like this.\" She showed the clerk her drawing.[br]\r\nHe had a look at the piece of paper, mumbled something, and walked away. Edwige eagerly followed him into the section littered with Herbariums.[br]\r\n[br]\r\nAfter a little search, the librarian pulled a tiny booklet from one of the shelves.[br]\r\n\"Is this the plant you saw?\" He showed her a page from the booklet. It was unmistakable, that was the plant.[br]\r\n\"Yes, that's it!\" Edwige couldn't contain her excitement. \"Can I have a read, please?\"[br]\r\n\"Of course,\" and he handed her the booklet.\r\n[quote]Found in the Mohari Desert, this seemingly innocent plant is the cause of many deaths among wanderers and animals. If one ever comes across this cactus, make them heed this warning. Should one drink the liquids of the Vertius, death will follow them relentlessly with great amounts of agony. For once the liquid has touched the insides of the body, it will not travel to ones stomach. Instead, it will enter the lungs sticking itself to the entire surface area, essentially [b]drowning[/b] its victim. There is no escape...|Mohari Menacing Mistakes[/quote][/aloud]\r\n\r\n[h3]The Ruins of the Alehouse[/h3]\r\n[p]Prompts: Vanish, Ruin, Haunt, Shadow, Whisper, Mist, Tear, Abandoned, Darkness[/p]\r\n[aloud]The walk through the swamp has taken an immense toll. At least four times, Edwige got stuck in the mud and had to pry her way out of the slack. Every step forward feels like a thousand on a normal road.[br]\r\nFinally, a dry patch of land! One deep breath and a short waddle later, Edwige seats herself on the lone log in the middle.[br]\r\n\"There you go, La-de-Da-de,\" she puts her tartoise beside her. \"Stay close, the log in small.\"[br]\r\nWithin a few seconds, she dozes off into the land of dreams.[br]\r\n[br]\r\n\"Edwige.\"[br]\r\n\"No, mum, let me sleep.\"[br]\r\n\"Edwige.\"[br]\r\n\"No.. let me.\"[br]\r\n\"Edwige.\"[br]\r\n\"I SAID NO!\"[br]\r\n[br]\r\nBathing in sweat, the little halfling wakes up. Her heavy breathing produces clouds of condensed water. The [b]whispers[/b] from her nightmare still [b]haunt[/b] her. Amist it all, a [b]tear[/b] rolls down her cheeks. What would her mother think of her, leaving her family behind like that and just [b]vanishing[/b] into a life of adventures.[br]\r\nFrom the corner of her eye, she notices movement among the trees. An animal? No, too large a [b]shadow[/b], unless there are large predators here that she does not know yet. Her hand slowly glides towards her left pocket and wraps it firmly around the hilt of her dagger.[br]\r\nEdwige puts La-de-Da-de in her backpack. With her hand still clutching onto the dagger, she continues to navigate her way through the swamp. There is an [b]abandoned ruin[/b] nearby that should provide some shelter for the night. All she has to do, is find the path...[br]\r\n[br]\r\nA bank of [b]mist[/b] rolls in, obscuring her vision even further.[br]\r\n[i]Squash! I cannot see anything. Where's the road?[/i][br]\r\nFrantically, Edwige tries to make her way through the fog in search of the pathway to the tavern. She must have walked in circles, as she passes the same log she sat on previously for the third time. Drained from energy, she seats herself on the log again while [b]darkness[/b] engulves her surroundings.[/aloud]",
