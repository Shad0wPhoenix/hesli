At the moment, Eshil knows a few powerful organisations, such as @[Limani Supplies Dealer](organization:5e89421c-6ff3-4051-bdeb-d087f1934349) and @[Sacred Knowledge](organization:e179613b-0b95-4070-8667-edcfa19c14e0). The only other power player currently missing from Eshil is the @[Kingdom of Illtresi](organization:d5cb649e-a3cd-4a2d-b065-5512783135ef). The dynamic between these organisations is something I still have to figure out.\r\n\r\nOther power that exists within the world are individuals with exceptional skill. These skills would be interesting to figure out, see if they come from a higher power or maybe from some other source. Items of old age can contain magic from creatures that no longer roam the lands of Hesli, or soar through its sky. These individuals and items will definitely form a great foundation and resource for the campaign that I plan to develop... at some point...

Truth be told, at the time I could hardly believe I had improved any significant or noticable amount. To my eyes, it was still the same [strike]crap[/strike] brain ramble as ever.\r\n\r\nRecently I looked back at my summer camp articles from '21 and the ones from '22 in hopes of getting my internal writing engine started once more. It has been a while since I last wrote for this world, or at all. My fresh eyes noticed the big differences right away. The articles of '22 were more cohesive and decorated with art. The contents were also less all-over-the-place and more geared towards what my world had become.\r\n\r\nLooking back at my old work taught me to appreciate the strides I have made as a writer and worldbuilder. But also that improvements aren't directly visible when you're neck deep into it. Sometimes, you need to crawl out of that pit and take a break, so you can look back at your work with fresh eyes. That's when the improvements will be most visible.\r\n\r\nOnce again, I would like to thank everyone who has followed my journey so far and who believed that I improved most last year. You guys are awesome!\r\n\r\n[center][color:#940606][section: fa-solid fa-heart fa-beat fa-2xl] [/section][/color][/center]\r\n\r\n[badge:388|c2798a52-1647-4e83-af08-d7ecef98b723]\r\n[/container][/container]\r\n[container:col-md-8]\r\n[h2]A peek into the Frontiers[/h2]\r\nThe second theme for the silver prompts is all about frontiers. It is a subject that hasn't crossed my mind before and therefore is a bit difficult for me to tackle. However, I'm certain once the prompts are released, I can think of something to answer them.\r\n\r\nStill, for now, I can imagine a few frontiers. @[Sacred Knowledge](organization:e179613b-0b95-4070-8667-edcfa19c14e0) is trying to bring back an old empire in the most covert way they can. They don't want to alert the @[Kingdom of Illtresi](organization:d5cb649e-a3cd-4a2d-b065-5512783135ef) to have the element of surprise. I can imagine that this would be a form of hidden frontier. In the cover of darkness, a political frontier is brewing, trying to oppose the kingdom or put them in a bad light to create division within the Kingdom. There are many ways to achieve this in multiple spaces and layers. Aside from the political frontier, a geographical frontier comes into play as potential battlefields and key locations for an invasion are forming. Creating a division within the Kingdom means that they would need to create a cultural frontier as well. A good canditate for that would be challenging the various religions that reach different ethnicities scattered throughout the region.\r\n\r\nAnother frontier I can imagine are related to the @[Limani Supplies Dealer](organization:5e89421c-6ff3-4051-bdeb-d087f1934349). They have a vast influence over the @[Eshil](location:251eb80c-8462-4cd2-ae93-dbb4ecb74af8) region and have solidified themselves as the trading and merchant company that can get anything done. Within the organisation are multiple sister organisations providing the merchants with everything they need, from vehicles and carriages, to trained security personnel. The wares they transport are valuable, especially the ones that go beyond their tight influence zone. Theft and piracy become the standard in these situations, where the ethics of the security personnel is also tested as they need to defend the parcel at any cost.\r\n\r\nThe last frontier that comes to mind has everything to do with the campaign I eventually hope to set up, and if that doesn't happen it might make its way into a fantasy novel or something. Ancient lore claims that dragons roamed the world. The current sapient species used to help them maintain the intricacies of the world. However, there are signs that their return is upon the world in a less than friendly way. It might be interesting to see if I can drop bits and bobs of their civilization to make their presence more visible in the lore of the world.\r\n\r\n[quote]There will always be a frontier where there is an open mind and a willing hand.|Charles Kettering[/quote]\r\n\r\n[h3]Other Examples of Frontiers in Hesli[/h3]\r\n[row][col][articleblock:51427dd0-7762-4ca4-adaa-34cf920c80f0][/col][col][articleblock:10e0791d-00c9-4565-b7a3-919dbcca6ad1][/col][/row]\r\n[/container][/container]\r\n\r\n[container:row align-items-stretch][container:col-md-8]\r\n[h2]Clues for Foreshadowing[/h2]\r\nThe gold prompts will be all about the relics of the world. I am [i]so[/i] excited for this theme, because it fits perfectly with my world! To give some context, in the beginning of the world, dragons created and wandered the lands. However, after @[The Draconic War](document:59bb8ea4-4e1f-4d47-9d3b-6761de8ac899), most of the dragons disappeared. Their return is imminent and fast approaching, and it's up to the adventurers to do something about it.\r\n\r\n[aloud]If you want to read more on the early history of the world, check out @[The Day of the Rising Sun](document:85f3db24-79e1-4f8f-8b24-dbbd2d601d28)! It's the first document of the @[The True Historical Documents of Hesli](item:6a31bfd0-6dc9-4d08-9595-13b20497c03d) series that outlines the rough history of the world.[/aloud]\r\n\r\nSo, where do relics come into play, you may ask? These dragons lived for quite some time on this world. Their civilization must have left something behind, be it items, ruins, graveyards, and more. All these things are relics! I really should add more of them throughout my world to make the old history come alive in the world. There are so many things I can do with it.\r\n\r\nMost of the world people don't know the true origin of the world, and therefore don't know anything about the relics and what powers they might hold. Unless you're one of the @[High Elves](species:94de1f60-4310-4c78-b3f6-4db374ee8ba4) that doesn't suffer from @[Cuille](condition:6f9ecc5b-772c-420b-b0d5-3d939c0f087c). What if these relics fall into the wrong hands? Can they be used for evil? But also, as relics and ruins become more known to the world and the truth comes out, what would happen? Would the people finally see the message that has been screaming at them all along?\r\n\r\nThe dragons [i]will[/i] return. Are the people up for the challenge of defending themselves against these mystical beasts? Or can they figure out another way to change their glooming future.\r\n\r\n[quote]Try as you will, you cannot annihilate that eternal relic of the human heart, love.|Victor Hugo[/quote]\r\n\r\n[h3]Other Examples of Relics in Hesli[/h3]\r\n[row][col][articleblock:829495b7-3f1b-499d-802e-7bb058e6fd87][/col][col][articleblock:c10d4b2a-7786-43d9-9c96-c508128d2ec8][/col][/row]\r\n[/container][container:col-md-4][container: panel panel-default card panel-body card-body]\r\n[container:in-article-sidebar][center][color:#940606][section:fa-solid fa-pencil fa-xl] [/section][/color] [b]Upgrading Skills[/b] [color:#940606][section:fa-solid fa-pencil fa-xl] [/section][/color][/center]\r\n\r\nIf there's one thing that goes hand in hand with relics, it would be actually drawing them. I have put some of my drawing scattered through my articles. Most of them are not of the highest quality in [i]my[/i] opinion, but I also know that I'm hard on myself.\r\n\r\nThis summer camp, I want to try and improve my drawing by simply.. drawing! There's no right or wrong; there is trying and practicing. Am I afraid that it might take precious time away from writing? Maybe.. probably.. but that doesn't deter me from making an honest attempt still. Everyone starts somewhere in their journey to improve on their skills, and mine is currently at the level of drawing stick-lanterns. Nothing wrong with that, I bet I can make a stick-latern look epic!\r\n\r\nHere is the thing, summer camp hasn't started [i]yet[/i], so I have time to already start practicing. There is much to learn, but I hope that picking a relatively small and simple subject prevents me from getting overwhelmed too quickly.\r\n\r\n[img:2878460]\r\n[/container][/container][/container]\r\n[/container]\r\n\r\n[container: row align-items-stretch][container:col-md-4][container:panel panel-default card panel-body card-body]\r\n[container:in-article-sidebar][center][color:#940606][section:fa-solid fa-signal-stream fa-xl] [/section][/color] [b]I'm Going Live on Twitch![/b] [color:#940606][section:fa-solid fa-signal-stream fa-xl] [/section][/color][/center][/container][br]\r\nLast year, I procrastinated a little too much on my summer camp prompts. As in, I still had to write 20+ prompts in just 5 days.. yeah, oops. So, in an attempt to give myself some extra [strike]anxiety[/strike] motivation, I decided to go for an impromptu Twitch stream during those days.\r\n\r\nIt was loads of fun, so I have decided to give it another go this summer camp! This time, I intent to simply discuss prompts, do some writing on stream, and entertain you all with my attempts at drawing [i]things[/i]. If, for some reason, I'm already through with the writing, I might do some reading sessions as well. I'm fairly certain I will need those for reasons that will be revealed.. later.\r\n\r\nThe plan, for now, is to stream during week days as I'm often away from home on the weekends. However, if there is time, I might as well, we'll see. This is a schedule that I think will be reasonable for me, but be aware that things might change once Summer Camp is actually happening. I will have a set starting time, but the end time may vary depending on how I'm feeling.\r\n\r\nTuesday: 20:00[br]\r\nWedsnesday: 20:00[br]\r\nThursday: 20:00[br]\r\n\r\nManaging energy levels will be a critical task for me, so if I don't appear online on a scheduled day, just know that I am most likely taking care of myself to avoid a burnout. ^^\r\n\r\nIf you feel like tagging along, feel free to follow me on [url:https://www.twitch.tv/shadowphoenix7899]Twitch[/url].\r\n[/container][/container]\r\n[container:col-md-8][h2]Think First, Communicate Second[/h2]\r\nTalking with people from all around the world stands at the roots of civilization. Without a way to communicate, it's hard to innovate because how can you collaborate, or even elaborate, an idea without a means to contact other likeminded people?\r\n\r\nOne of the popular ways to communicate in Eshil, at least, is by using a @[WafflePhoenix](species:e1570f33-4ba3-4948-b5df-22d0edfb3348) to deliver a message. Most people use normal pen en paper to send their messages. However, the @[Limani Supplies Dealer](organization:5e89421c-6ff3-4051-bdeb-d087f1934349) have figured out another solution for their message. See, a trading organisation of this caliber doesn't want their messages to fall into the wrong hands. If thieves knew a valuable payload would be moved from point A to point B, there's a high chance of trouble. How? I'll explain that in the @[Limani Supplies Dealer Messages](item:0d16f47e-00c0-49fe-beb0-6c468442cb8b) during this summer camp.\r\n\r\n@[Sacred Knowledge](organization:e179613b-0b95-4070-8667-edcfa19c14e0) is another big organisation, but this one relies on its secrecy and staying in the shadows to avoid detection of their plans. They certainly have to communicate in a unique way. If their plans for overtaking the kingdom leaks, they lose the element of surprise.\r\n\r\n[quote]The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said.|Peter Drucker[/quote]\r\n\r\n[h3]Other Examples of Communication in Hesli[/h3]\r\n[row][col][articleblock:dfb6269b-849d-437c-a7d2-b11ce20fe8bd][/col][col][articleblock:1c10fa6c-a8bb-4f3d-978e-bfa9db3d82e8][/col][/row]\r\n[/container][/container]",
