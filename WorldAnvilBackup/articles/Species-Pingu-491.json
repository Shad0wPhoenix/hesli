    "content": "Famous for their - often black and white - feathery coats capable of withstanding ~ nay, allowing them to [i]thrive[/i] in the immense cold are none other than the pingus. These tuxedoed creatures waddle their way through life on land, alternating with bellysliding (or tobogganing) over snow and ice for more speed. As an essential part of the bustling societies that have sprung up around @[Bahrid](location:047f5b3b-7abe-4982-b0c6-9c8e6382a844), pingus have proven themselves to be a versatile species. However, their true home is elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[quote]Whoah, look at them go — these pingus swim just as fast as the boat!|A surprised traveller on the ferry to Bahrid[/quote]\r\n\r\n[h2]Waddling through Life[/h2]\r\nA variety of pingu species toddle their way through the snowy plains of Bahrid to their homes and communities. This doesn't go without a hitch. Walking upright is quite the challenge and it's often met with a thud to the ground. Good thing pingus have a thick layer of fat all around to absorb the shock during the pingu-meets-immovable-object spectacle. While their clumsiness on ice and rocky shores is highly entertaining to outsiders, it also shows how remarkably sturdy these birds are. Sure, they may fall a few meters to the ground, but they will get right back up and continue their way forward or upward.\r\n\r\n[row][col]One common aspect among all pingus is their way of breeding. While duration may differ, it all comes down to pairing up, laying an egg, brood, and a little chick will pop out when the time is right. These little balls of down only know two things: the call of their parents and that fish is tasty. If all goes well, these chicks will grow at an immense speed, usually trading their down feathers for their juvenile coats after a few months.[/col]\r\n[col][quote]Like many birds, pingus replace their feathers every year. However, their process of moulting is unique: they shed and replace their feathers all at once roughly in the span of a month. Without their waterproof coat they cannot go swimming and hunting, so it's a tough month of being unable to eat while consuming a lot of energy.|Bahrid Explorers Guide[/quote][/col][/row]\r\n\r\nWith a nice waterproof coat, young pingus instinctively know how to swim and hunt for fish. They tag along with other pingus of the colony into the open ocean for months at a time. They cannot breathe while underwater, so at most a quarter of the flock will leap out of the water for air while the others keep an eye out for predators. They may have a pact with their biggest predator, the @[Mahawt](species:d7cbfb7d-6fcd-44d7-b3b4-5c1e91e7f83b) - thanks to the @[Qadim Pingus](species:a37f3d39-b34a-4ec1-90ed-f869f8e4ed4b) - but they are far from the only threats lurking in the depths of the oceans.\r\n\r\n[aloud]\"Come son, it's time to go fishing!\"[br]\r\n\"But muuummm, how do I even sleep if we keep swimming? It's impossible!\"[br]\r\n\"Just nap!\"[br]\r\n\"Nap?\"[br]\r\n\"Yeah! For like.. 10 seconds or so every few minutes. Your cousins take 10.000 naps a day like that!\"[br]\r\n\"Wh.. what?!\"[/aloud]\r\n\r\nOutside the vast borders of Bahrid - where the cold climate and sea ice provides a safe haven for the cold-loving residents of the island - the pingus have few physical encounters with the people inhabiting the less frigid parts of Hesli. When they happen to stumble upon anyone out at sea, the reaction is often the same: shooing away the birds because they clearly are stealing fish.  Which, ironically, is their own fault, as overfishing has left the ocean scarred and the pingus hunting longer for food.",

    "fullfooter": "[container:left col-md-4][img:6140648][/container][h2]Flying through Water[/h2]\r\nEach pingu has a rather slim beak with a barbed tongue which allows them to catch and swallow fish more easily. Their feet consist of a thick layer of fat around the bones to cushion the antics pingus are up to. The thick scales on the outside and sturdy claws allow them to maintain as much grip as possible when waddling over the ice sheets. It is clear that these birds have evolved to flourish and fly — just not through air, but through water.\r\n\r\nThe entire build of a pingu lends itself for speeding through the oceans. Their torpedo shape provides the least resistance in the water. With their feet positioned relatively far to the back, they are in the perfect position to function as rudders to help with steering the pingu in the water and their thin wings with a relatively high surface area only adds to their already great manouverability. In order to flap those flippers to propell a pingu forward in all conditions - therefore also against the current - the chest and back muscles are very developed to produce the power needed. The force that the flippers have to endure is also apparent in the bone structure when looking at the heavily reinforced and thick bones.\r\n\r\n[container: right col-md-3][aloud]The ratio between the length of the flipper and the total body length differs among the various pingus which has a direct correlation with the depth they can reach when diving. The smaller this ratio, the deeper the pingu can dive![/aloud][/container]\r\n\r\nThe organs and blood vessels of pingus have also adapted to life in the oceans for months at a time. They have a good set of lungs allowing them to dive for minutes at a time. The heart can pump blood through their body at a very low speed while diving to conserve as much energy as possible. Gamar pingus even have the ability to contract bloodvessels to specific bodyparts to avoid unnecessary energy consumption, but also to retain more heat while deepdiving.\r\n\r\n[h2]Tuxedoed Torpedoes[/h2]\r\nOf course, the pingu are most well known for the dense pack of feathers that resemble a tuxedo. Each subspecies has a few patterns unique to them with elements common among all pingus.\r\n\r\n[container: right col-md-5][img:6140649][/container]While the outfit looks fun, the composition of the feathers is what allows them to thrive in the cold environment both on land and in the ocean. They mainly consist of four types of feathers each fulfilling their task. The smallest down feathers help keeping the pingu warm while other feathers help waterproofing the coat which also helps the pingu retaining heat while swimming.\r\n\r\nThe most impressive feature of this coat is trapping and releasing air. This mechanic allows pingus to apply a boost while swimming — that's how they can shoot out of the water and cover the distance between the water surface and the icy cliffs up for up to 5 meters.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the exact composition and ratio between the types of feathers differs between the subspecies. The speedy Rahab pingus apply the boost mostly to gain or maintain speed while swimming - increasing their endurance for long distances dramatically - whereas the Gamar pingus use it to dive deeper than any pingu for the tastiest fish.",
    "authornotes": "It probably doesn't come as a surprise that Pingus are [i]heavily[/i] inspired by the penguin of earth. I've put a good chunk of research into this article to represent penguins as best as possible.\r\n\r\nAside from the obvious change in the pattern of the coat, everything in this article are true facts about penguins (though some simplified)! As for the drawings, especially the anatomy one; I tried my best to be as accurate as possible! Drawing the bones and muscles was very difficult for me, but the gist is there. ^^\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoyed it and if you have any questions, feel free to ask!",
