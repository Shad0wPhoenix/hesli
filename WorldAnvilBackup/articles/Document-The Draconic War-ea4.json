Mum and dad want me to pack all our most precious belongings and bring it to the safehouse that our great grandfather had build. They seemed in a hurry and want me to go as quickly as I can. Dad even said that I had to stay in there as long as possible and not to get out unless absolutely necessary...\r\n\r\nI have a bad feeling about this, but there's no time to think twice. Something is wrong, very wrong, otherwise they wouldn't ask this of me. The safehouse is at least a week's flight travel, and they want me to go by foot as much as I can! Only fly low to the ground and take detours. They'll give me a map with a route I can follow with places to stay. I wonder what I'll see on my journey.\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\nIt's been a few days since I've been on the road and it is horrifying! We knew Luna to be gone, but we didn't expect this... resistance to start a war! They're slaughtering our tiny friends! What use is there in killing them?! And they're even fighting the others of their own kind! Dad assured me he and mum will be alright and reunite with me, but I have a feeling that this is far from over. This conflict... we never took up arms before.\r\n\r\nI must continue and endure this for as long as I can. Hopefully dad will be at the safehouse soon. For me, it's at least a 8, maybe 14 days travel left. That is, if nothing comes on my path. I've managed to avoid a few enemy patrols. Thanks dad for the tricks.\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\nI have arrived at the safehouse. It's somewhere in the middle of the icy mountains. I'm glad that we can endure the cold so well, otherwise I would've frozen to death. But now I'm all alone out here... Dad told me not to try and contact him, as it might give away my location. I guess I'll explore the safehouse a bit and figure out what to do with food. I'm not hungry yet, but meat should stay preserved fairly well out here in the cold.\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\nI found a little note here in the house! It says that if the ball glows red, to come outside. No idea how it is supposed to glow red, but it did today! I peeked outside and found a letter from dad. It's getting worse, the rest of the Nannarians are fighting against the Disciples of Chaos. He included some more details in the letter regarding an ancient artefact for me to guard along with some survival tips.\r\n\r\nWhile he didn't say it explicitely in the letter, I fear that he won't be surviving the fight. I'm safe here, no one will look near these icy planes since everyone moved towards the big lake. I just... I just hope he'll survive and see what else there is I can do.\r\n\r\n[/quote]",
