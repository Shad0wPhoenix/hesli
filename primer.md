## Welcome in Hesli, Curious Bean!
Hesli is a world filled with adventure and cosy/wholesome vibes, where you shouldn't believe everything at face value: concealed meanings, unsuspecting twists, and dangers hide in plain sight waiting for the right moment and opportunity to strike.

### So, where do we kick off?
Many people start their adventures in Limani, [Eshil](./regions/eshil.md) - a bustling region filled with a wide variety of places, biomes, people, and cultures to explore. [Limani](./regions/eshil/limani.md) is one of the prominent hubs in this region. As a key point in the trading network - with people flocking to the city to become part of the Limani Supplies Dealers - it has become this brewing pot of ethnicities and traditions.

If you're looking for some work, be sure to find [Ashish Ludak](./npcs/eshil/ashishLudak.md) or immediately head to [the Wandering Lileon](./regions/eshil/limani/wanderingLileon.md) to speak with the owner [Barnabas Stripepaw](./npcs/eshil/barnabasStripepaw.md). Otherwise, feel free to explore the town or the nearby villages!

### Companions
