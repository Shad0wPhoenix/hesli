# Welcome in Hesli, Curious Bean!
Hesli is a world filled with adventure and cosy/wholesome vibes, where you shouldn't believe everything at face value: concealed meanings, unsuspecting twists, and dangers hide in plain sight waiting for the right moment and opportunity to strike.

## So, where do we kick off?
Many people start their adventures in Limani, [Eshil](./regions/eshil.md) - a bustling region filled with a wide variety of places, biomes, people, and cultures to explore. [Limani](./regions/eshil/limani.md) is one of the prominent hubs in this region. As a key point in the trading network - with people flocking to the city to become part of the Limani Supplies Dealers - it has become this brewing pot of ethnicities and traditions.

If you're looking for some work, be sure to find [Ashish Ludak](./npcs/eshil/ashishLudak.md) or immediately head to [the Wandering Lileon](./regions/eshil/limani/wanderingLileon.md) to speak with the owner [Barnabas Stripepaw](./npcs/eshil/barnabasStripepaw.md). Otherwise, feel free to explore the town or the nearby villages!

## Companions
There are many ways to explore the wonders of Hesli.

Are you alone and looking for work to get your life as an adventurer started? Be sure to check out the local pubs and quest boards, surely you can make some friends there to start an adventuring company. Or maybe you fancy a life working for one of the organisations that allows you to travel the world.

If you already arrive with your adventuring company, the same applies! Look around, check out the quest boards and be on your merry way.

> A word of advice; make some good friends along the way! You never know when you might need a favour or simply a trusting set of hands when you find yourself in a pinch. - Ashish Ludak

## What's going on?
While Eshil may look peaceful on the outside, there are plenty forces active within trying to suppress a grim reality.

### A Covert Brotherhood Stirring the Pot
People are certain that there is an underground organisation moving in the shadows. It is still unknown what their intentions are and who they are. However, it is clear that this organisation is politicallly active. There are rumours that the [Limani Supplies Dealer]() is working together with the [Durkdealer]() and their information network to uncover the mystery and put an end to whatever it is this brotherhood is plotting.

### A Terrifying Propect in Theorston Thicket
People have been disappearing left and right over the past couple years. However, in the past few months the number of disappearances have tripled causing alarm. What's worse; they vanish without a trace. People suspect it has something to do with the reports on increased activity in Theorston Thicket, the home of Archmage Anvar. If his disciples are trying to bring him back from the dead, the world is in for a whole new set of problems.

### But where can I start?
Naturally, you cannot simply dive into these grand problems like a headless chicken after your arrival in [Limani](./regions/eshil/limani.md). However, that doesn't mean there's nothing for you to do. Here are a few pointers to help you get started on your journey in Eshil. 

- Many merchants from the [Limani Supplies Dealer]() are getting robbed at broad daylight without any reprecussions. The organisation doesn't have enough hands for fully protecting their merchants against this. They've grown so desperate that they hire fresh adventurers to guard their junior and minor merchants.

- [Barnabas Stripepaw](./npcs/eshil/barnabasStripepaw.md) has some errands to run but not enough time to do it himself. If you help him out at [the Wandering Lileon](./regions/eshil/limani/wanderingLileon.md), he'll give you great rewards. They're relatively simple jobs, but when done well it could earn you the trust of the lileon, who might have more pressing issues that he only shares with those he trusts.

- [Ashish Ludak](./npcs/eshil/ashishLudak.md) requires some information from one of their informants who hasn't returned from their mission yet. If you can get the information to Ashish, they will reward you greatly. If done well, you might even earn their trust which could land you some more interesting quests.

### But I want explore a little first!
Totally understandable, a fresh world, a new city, it's only natural wanting to see what's out there before getting in the heat of things. There are plenty small villages around [Limani](./regions/eshil/limani.md), shrines and temples to explore and learn more about the religions that are intertwined in this multicultural area.

[Barnabas](./npcs/eshil/barnabasStripepaw.md) and [Ashish](./npcs/eshil/ashishLudak.md) have plenty connections and knowledge in and around the town. So, if you're looking for something specific, there's no harm in asking them for some directions.

## Technology and Magic
When trekking through Hesli, you will encounter various levels of technology and magic. Some communities are more advanced in one or the other while others just prattle on clinging to the old ways of life. 

That said, the technology level will not advance much further than our human world has seen during the very early industrial revolution. The use of steam will be very much limited, so you're most likely to see technology from the middle ages.

As for magic, it.. exists. You won't find excessive use and power, similar to the level of technology in this world. Don't feel too comfortable yet, because there certainly are powerful magic users just not as common.

## I want to play! What character can I make?
There are a few playable species in Hesli. You might already be familiar with most of them by their name, but be sure to read through their articles regardless. There are some interesting twists to take into account.

### Elf
Generally recognisable by their slender figure and long ears, elves come in a few variations but all with the same quirk: they have a hard time traversing "impure" water. If you are to believe the [High Elves](./encyclopaedia/biota/fauna/people/elf/highElf.md), they are descendants from the [Gold Dragons](./encyclopaedia/myths&legends/dragons/goldDragon.md) â€” but not everyone believes that, even among the various species of elves.

### Dwarf
Most people know dwarfs as these mountain-dwelling and axe-swinging drunken bastards eager to run headfirst into a fight. Here in Hesli, you can definitely find these stereotypical dwarfs. However, there are also magic-wielding dwarfs that love exploring the outdoors feeling inclined to keep the lands and riverbanks prosperous.
