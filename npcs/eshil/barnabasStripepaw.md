**Character Study**
Barnabas is a man of great patience with a peculiar appearence, not found anywhere in Limani or even Eshil. His fiery yellow eyes piece through your soul seemingly capable of reading your very emotions. The apple green fur with anthracite stripes decorated with bright purple manes attract the attention of everyone in a crowded street. Dwarfing everyone on his hind-legs at a staggering 3.6m (11'10") at 280kg makes him intimidating to look at, but he wouldn't hurt a fly unless deserved.

## A Striped Oddity
As the only Lileon wandering through [Limani](../../regions/eshil/limani.md), Barnabas is quite the sight to behold. Especially people new to the town who see the gentle giant for the first time, have the shock of a lifetime when he opens his mouth and casually talks. It takes some getting used to, but people soon realise that he cannot hurt a fly.

This gentle giant provides a listening ear to everyone. Barnabas loves to hear other people's stories and ponder over them. The citizens of Limani are aware of this and therefore come to his establishment to vent about the problems they face, or just anything else that comes to mind. His calm and inviting personality makes him very approachable for these rambling sessions.

Barnabas is also a great conversationalist himself. He gets excited when he can discuss his topics of interest to gain the insight and perspective of other people. Brainstorming to come up with a solution to someone's problem is another favourite. These two traits, combined with his welcoming attitude, results in this Lileon knowing what the people of the town and surrounding need. It makes him the ideal person to inform for quests for adventurers of any level.

## The All-Knowing Mystery
While Barnabas has become the staple of Limani, many of its citizens know next to nothing about this giants past. Whenever the topic of his past makes its way into the conversation, the barkeep manages to professionally elude the subject. He will strategically change it to move the discussion away from what he did before coming to town and setting up his tavern. Patrons that continue to pressure Barnabas into revealing more about his past, will receive a stern look as an answer.
