**Character Study**
Ashish with their upbeat mood bounces through life like a skippyball. Their long and black hair - often braided - wave through the air accompanied by their surprisingly pale skin. With lively and dark amber eyes, they are capable of spotting every new and old adventurer setting foot in down; which is rather impressive, considering they are a mere 90cm (3ft) all. If anything, it is almost a miracle Ashish hasn't been blown away by the wind yet with just 16kgs holder her on the ground.

## The Dashing Informant
While their statue might be small, Ashish makes up for it in character. Their exuberant personality is charming and gives the people around their energy. Surely, their love for exaggeration might put perspectives out of proportion, but not in a malicious way.

Aside from their dazzling nature, Ashish has a particular knack for gathering, obtaining, and selling information. They have eyes and ears everywhere in the city; informants that work for them and bring them up to speed on everything that is going on in the city. Any information you need, they will either have it or will get it for you.

> Of course, darling. I can get you the whereabouts of the treasured Boara Relic. However, such sensitive information... that'll cost you a pretty penny. Are you up for that? - Ashish

## A Meticulous Strategist
Not much of Ashish's history from before their arrival in Limani is widely known. People believe that they came here after they ran away from their pilgrimage. Just before they arrived, they were a young and fagile person who quickly learned about the brutality of the outside world. Confronted with these unspeakable events, they have vowed to do everything in their power to bring a little justice by using their knowledge of information trade. Ever since, they have made a name for themself and have become the main information broker in the region.

How Ashish is able to obtain all this information as easily as they seem to do, remains a mystery for most people in town. Many citizens are aware that they have many informants scattered through the town and the surrounding regions. However, according to popular belief it is their bubbly personality allows them to put an irresistable charm on anyone. Charmed, these individuals likely give away the information for free which means profit for Ashish.
